            <h4>Software Developer</h4>
            <p>I am a junior software developer, a student at the PLP Academy, specialized in Python Django.
                At PLP Academy, we build different Django projects and even incorporated APIs. 
                I am still developing my Django skills while incorporating other skills like website development with HTML.
                Backend development with Django is a journey that I have just started. I am looking forward to building my proficiency with time.
                I am looking forward to mastery of Python. I will apply all these to come up with initiative to improve the Health Systems.</p>
            <h4>Project Manager</h4>
            <p>As an undergraduate student of Project Management, I have come to appreciate the dynamics of projects in the macro/microenvironment.
                The skills that I have acquired overtime, including but not limited to: Project Quality Management with customer satisfaction at the centre,
                project management process from initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and control to closing; Tools and techniques used in
                Project Charter development, Project Management Plans, Project Scope Management, Project Time Management and Project Cost Management, 
                have become handy in my path as a student and in my other daily duties in the health sector.
